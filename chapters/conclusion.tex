We have investigated and implemented modern model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm: Advantage Actor Critic. We have measured its performance its ability to learn complex tasks, namely playing a modern video game with access to information similar to what a human player would have. 
\\\\
As a result, we have released an open-source implementation of the reference ANN based architecture described by DeepMind~\cite{Vinyals2017}. We have shown that our implementation is able to match reference results under mild game configuration simplifications to make the task feasible without access to expensive hardware. 
\\\\
Our open source implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/inoryy/pysc2-rl-agent} and a video recording of the agent navigating reference tasks can be seen at \url{https://youtu.be/gEyBzcPU5-w}.
